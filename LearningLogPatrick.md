<h3>Things I learnt</h3>
I learnt a greater connection between the importance of storage devices and it's associated number system to other computer components
and the user. I learnt about the diverse history of storage devices that I had no prior knowledge. It goes to show how lucky we are in this day and age to have a considerable amount of data capacity that can be stored in a pocket. Regarding the history I learned, I was surprised to learn that a storage device which resembled the size of an entire wardrobe, could only store up to a few kilobytes. I also learned the fluidity of code and the wide set of code that is avilable to make a creatively made website using HTML. Making a website of 
our own opened my eyes to the process of of making a website, since I now know the basic backbone behind the internet. 

<h3>Things that I still want to learn</h3>
Things I still want to learn are more programming languages to expose myself to an even wider spectrum of options to create a website. Not only do I want to extend my knowledge on creating websites, but I hope to learn other formats of programming such as creating software, interactive programs and maybe even games. I believe that creating this website provided me with a basic foundation of creating websites and programming and learning how to combine code together and learning how they interact with eachother.
