<h3>What is the history of this computer part?</h3>
        <p>The history of storage devices goes back to the early 20th century. Only a few decades ago, storage devices were extremely large in size, comparable to a wardrobe, and could only hold a few kilobytes of data. Today, we have storage devices that could easily be put into out pocket being able to hold gigabytes of data. Thanks to these improvements of storage devices transformed computers from being large and a luxury only found in big companies, government and universities to being decreased in size, allowing for personal computers to emerge</p>
<ul>
    <li>1971 - <em>IBM</em> invents the 8-inch floppy disk, the first portable storage devie made of magnetic film escased in plastic, making it easier and faster to store data</li>
    <br>
    <li>1980 - James T.Russel invents the <em>Compact Disc (CD)</em>. He thought of using light to record and play music. When Russel completed his project, he presented it to Sony</li>
    <br>
    <li>1994 - <em>CompactFlash (CF)</em>, also known as Flash Drives, used flash memory in an enclosed disc to save digital data. They are used in digital cameras and computers to store digital information</li>
    <br>
    <li>1995 - <em>DVD</em>, became the next generation of digital disc storage, which served as a better alternative to the compact disc</li>
    <br>
    <li>1997 - <em>The Multimedia Card</em>, uses a flash memory card standard to store digital data, introduced by Sandisk and Siemen's</li>
    <br>
    <li>1999 - <em>The Microdrive</em>, or USB Flash Drive uses a NAND-type flash memory to store digital data. The USB plugs into the USP interface on standard computers</li>
    <br>
    <li>2003 - <em>Blu-Ray</em>, became the next generation of optical disc format which is used to store high definition video (HD)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Present - <em>Cloud Data Storage</em>. Internet bandwidth improved and storage capacity fell in price, meaning that it was more economical for business and individuals to outsource their data to the cloud, rather than buying, maintaing and replacing their own hardware. The Cloud Storage also increased accesibility, allowing for users to access data on multiple devices</li>
